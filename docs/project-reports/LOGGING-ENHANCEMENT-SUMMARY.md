# NETOPT Logging & Feedback Enhancement Summary

## Overview

Enhanced both the installer feedback and service logging systems with comprehensive tracking, detailed reports, and structured logging.

---

## ✅ What Was Enhanced

### 1. **Installer Feedback System** (NEW)

**File:** `lib/installer/installer-feedback.sh` (370 lines)

**Features Added:**
- ✅ **Step-by-step progress tracking** with [X/Y] notation
- ✅ **Real-time change tracking** (files created, modified, services installed)
- ✅ **Color-coded visual feedback** (success=green, warning=yellow, error=red)
- ✅ **Progress bars** for long operations
- ✅ **Installation report generation** (detailed manifest of all changes)
- ✅ **Before/After system state comparison**
- ✅ **File size and type reporting**
- ✅ **Dependency installation feedback**
- ✅ **Service verification** after installation

**Example Output:**
```
[3/10] Installing dependencies...
  ⟳ Installing iproute2 via apt...
  ✓ iproute2 (already installed)
  ⟳ Installing ethtool via apt...
  ✓ ethtool installed
  ✓ Complete

[4/10] Installing NETOPT files...
  + Created directory: /opt/netopt/lib
  ✓ Installed main script (7.0K)
  ✓ Installed library files
  ✓ Created command symlink
  ✓ Complete

╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                  INSTALLATION COMPLETE                            ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Installation Statistics:
  ✓ Files Created: 15
  ✓ Files Modified: 2
  ✓ Services Installed: 1
  ✓ Dependencies Installed: 2
```

### 2. **Service Logger** (NEW)

**File:** `lib/network/service-logger.sh` (280 lines)

**Features Added:**
- ✅ **Service lifecycle logging** (start, stop, reload phases)
- ✅ **Pre-flight check logging** with pass/fail status
- ✅ **Network state logging** (interfaces, routes, DNS before/after)
- ✅ **Interface test logging** (per-interface results with latency/weight)
- ✅ **Route application logging** (multipath configuration details)
- ✅ **TCP optimization logging** (all sysctl parameters)
- ✅ **Validation logging** (post-execution checks)
- ✅ **Performance metrics logging** (timing, duration)
- ✅ **JSON structured logging** for monitoring systems
- ✅ **Audit event logging** with metadata

**Integration with Core Logger:**
- Uses `lib/core/logger.sh` for base functionality
- Extends with service-specific functions
- Maintains all log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL)

### 3. **Enhanced Systemd Service** (NEW)

**File:** `systemd/netopt-verbose.service` (150 lines)

**Improvements Over Original:**
- ✅ **5-phase execution** with distinct logging for each
- ✅ **Pre-flight validation** (6 checks before applying changes)
- ✅ **Network state capture** (before and after)
- ✅ **Checkpoint creation** before any changes
- ✅ **Inline logging integration** (pipes output through logger)
- ✅ **Post-execution validation** (4 connectivity checks)
- ✅ **Auto-rollback on failure** (if validation fails)
- ✅ **Performance timing** (logs execution duration)
- ✅ **JSON event logging** for monitoring
- ✅ **Structured error messages** with context

**Service Phases:**
1. **Pre-flight Checks** - Validate system before changes
2. **Before State Capture** - Record current network configuration
3. **Checkpoint Creation** - Create restoration point
4. **Optimization Execution** - Apply network changes with logging
5. **Post-Validation** - Verify changes successful
